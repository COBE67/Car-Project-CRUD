# Car-Project-CRUD
This is a small project aimed at using graphQL playgrounds functions of Query and Mutation. 
Using the playground to create a CRUD application using selected classic car data.
Using the GraphQL playground, I created a small database of cars which I am able to currently preform the
  Create, Read and Delete functions. I am currently working on the updateCar function.
